## Worth mentioning

I'm new to ZSH and only started using it because [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/news/kali-linux-2020-3-release/) decided to go that route and I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about. I set up this theme based on how I had my bash prompt set up. I rarely use Mac so I don't know how it would look there and it took about a day and 3 hours of fiddling around to get this point. Enjoy ðŸ™‚!! (or not ðŸ¤¬). ðŸ’¡
