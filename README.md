# lightbulb.zsh-theme

A ZSH theme that displays the following:

- ðŸ’½: <span style="color:blue">OS</span> - <span style="color:yellow">Kernel Information</span>[ - <span style="color:red">\*\*\*REBOOT REQUESTED\*\*\*</span>]
- â•°â”€ðŸ•°: <span style="color:green">Datetime</span> - **<span style="color:magenta">Uptime</span>**
- â•°â”€â”€ðŸ“‚: **<span style="color:cyan">Current directory</span>** (<span style="color:red">Number of files</span> and <span style="color:magenta">total size</span>)
-  â•°â”€â”€â”€ðŸ™‚|ðŸ¤¬@ðŸ–¥: Job status(Good|Bad) <span style="color:blue">username</span><span style="color:red">@</span><span style="color:cyan"><ins>hostname</ins></span>
-  â•°â”€â”€â”€â”€>ðŸ’¡: <span style="color:magenta">TTY</span> **<span style="color:blue">git:(</span>status<span style="color:blue">)</span>** ->

## New feature

This will now let you know if you open a terminal that a reboot is requested. The reboot checker for CentOS/Fedora depends on yum-utils/dnf-utils. Ubuntu checks for /var/run/reboot-required.

## Worth mentioning

I'm new to ZSH and only started using it because [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/news/kali-linux-2020-3-release/) decided to go that route and I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about.
  I set up this theme based on how I had my bash prompt set up.
  I've tested on Fedora and CentOS which is what I mainly use. Ubuntu seems to work as well.

Enjoy ðŸ™‚ (or not ðŸ¤¬)!! ðŸ’¡
